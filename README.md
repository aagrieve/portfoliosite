## Information

This project was the final assignment for the Intro to Web Development course I took in Winter 2023. It was my first attempt at making a website from scratch. I am happy to have completed it, and definitely improved my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JS during the process.

If I had more time to work on the project, I would have explored bootstrap or a different CSS framework. I used grid and flexbox, which I think limited my structural success with the time constraint. Additionally, I would have liked to add a dark mode.

## How to run

- Download the files from this repository
- The HTML file can simply be opened in any browser
- The JS script will run as long as the directory is downloaded
- The site should be running on your machine
